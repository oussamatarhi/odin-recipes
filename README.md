# Description

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum, specifically designed as
the first assignment within the "Foundations Course."

Its primary purpose is to provide learners with a hands-on opportunity to apply
and reinforce their understanding of fundamental HTML concepts.

By completing this project, students can practice structuring content effectively while gaining confidence in using HTML to create well-organized and semantically correct web pages.

## Skills and Techniques Utilized

This project involved the application of various fundamental HTML skills and techniques, including:

-   **HTML Headings**: Organized content into clear and structured sections using heading tags (e.g., `<h1>` to `<h6>`).
-   **HTML Paragraphs**: Added descriptive and explanatory text using `<p>` tags to improve readability.
-   **HTML Links**: Created internal (relative) hyperlinks using `<a>` tags for easy navigation.
-   **Unordered Lists**: Used `<ul>` and `<li>` elements to display lists with bullet points, enhancing content clarity.
-   **Ordered Lists**: Applied `<ol>` and `<li>` elements to present items in a logical, numbered sequence.
-   **HTML Images**: Embedded images with the `<img>` tag to visually complement
    and enrich the content.

These foundational skills were practiced to develop a deeper understanding of HTML's role in creating structured, accessible, and visually coherent web pages.
